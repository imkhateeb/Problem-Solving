The provided code creates a simple logging mechanism using a `Logger` class in C++. Each time a `Logger` object is instantiated, it prints a message indicating that the instance was created successfully. The `Log` method prints the provided message to the console.

### Key Observations:
1. **Multiple Instances of Logger**:
   - Two instances of `Logger` (`logger1` and `logger2`) are being created using `new`.
   - This implies manual memory management. However, there's no `delete` statement, so memory allocated for the `Logger` instances isn't freed, leading to memory leaks.

2. **Improvements for Memory Management**:
   - To avoid memory leaks, you could either explicitly `delete` the objects or use smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to handle automatic cleanup.

3. **Singleton Design Pattern**:
   - If you intend the `Logger` class to be a global logging utility with a single instance across the application, you might want to implement the Singleton pattern. This would ensure only one instance of the `Logger` is created and used throughout the program.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Memory Management with Smart Pointers**:
   Instead of raw pointers, use `std::unique_ptr` for automatic memory management.

2. **Implementing a Singleton Logger**:
   If you want to enforce a single logger instance, here's how you can modify the design:

```cpp
// Logger.hpp
#ifndef LOGGER_H
#define LOGGER_H

#include <string>

class Logger
{
public:
  static Logger &GetInstance();
  void Log(const std::string &msg);

private:
  Logger();                                   // Private constructor to enforce singleton pattern
  Logger(const Logger &) = delete;            // Prevent copying
  Logger &operator=(const Logger &) = delete; // Prevent assignment
};

#endif

// Logger.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Logger.hpp"

Logger::Logger()
{
  std::cout << "Instance of Logger created successfully" << std::endl;
}

Logger &Logger::GetInstance()
{
  static Logger instance; // Guaranteed to be destroyed and instantiated on first use.
  return instance;
}

void Logger::Log(const std::string &msg)
{
  std::cout << msg << std::endl;
}

// Client.cpp
#include "Logger.hpp"

int main()
{
  Logger::GetInstance().Log("This message will get logged.");
  Logger::GetInstance().Log("This message is logged again.");

  return 0;
}
```

        ## #Key Changes : 1. *
        *Singleton ** : The `Logger` class has a static method `GetInstance` to provide access to the single instance of the logger.2. * *Private Constructor ** : The constructor is private to prevent external instantiation.3. * *Deleted Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator ** : These are deleted to prevent copying or
    assigning the singleton instance.

    This approach guarantees that only one instance of `Logger` is ever created and used throughout the program.
